		<h1>The Tower Of London</h1>

		<div id="intro">
			<h4>Introduction</h4>
			<p>The Tower of London has played a prominent role in English history. It was besieged several times and controlling it has been important to controlling the country. The Tower has served variously as an armoury, a treasury, a menagerie, the home of the <span>Royal Mint</span>, a public records office, and the home of the <span>Crown Jewels</span> of the United Kingdom. From the early 14th century until the reign of Charles II, a procession would be led from the Tower to Westminster Abbey on the coronation of a monarch.</p>

			<p class="fact">Most of the early <em>Norman castles</em> were built from timber, but by the end of the 11th century a few, including the Tower of London, had been renovated or replaced with stone</p>

			<h4>Architecture</h4>
			<p>As a result of Henry's expansion, St Peter ad Vincula, a Norman chapel which had previously stood outside the Tower, was incorporated into the castle. Henry decorated the chapel by adding glazed windows, and stalls for himself and his queen</p>

			<p class="fact">Edward extended the <em>south side</em> of the Tower of London onto land that had previously been submerged by the River Thames.</p>
