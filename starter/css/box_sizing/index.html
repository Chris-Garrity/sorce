				<img src="media/house_b.jpg" />
				<p>The residence is located on the famous Drevviken Lake, and takes the form of a simple white monolith, to blend in with its environment.</p>

			<div class="column">
				<img src="media/house_c.jpg" />
				<p>The house features an enclosed courtyard toward the back, and a terrace at the front.</p>

			<div class="column">
				<img src="media/house_d.jpg" />
				<p>Quietly secluded within the barren landscape, the architecture is contemporary, and is nearly invisible during winter.</p>
