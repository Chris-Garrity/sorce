			<h1>Under Milk Wood by Dylan Thomas</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<div>
				<h4>To begin at <span>the</span> beginning</h4>
				<p>It is spring, moonless night in <span>the</span> small town, starless
				and bible-black, <span>the</span> cobblestreets silent and <span>the</span> hunched,
				courters'-and-rabbits' wood limping invisible down to <span>the</span>
				sloeblack, slow, black, crowblack, fishingboatbobbing sea.
				<span>the</span> houses are blind as moles (though moles see fine to-night
				in <span>the</span> snouting, velvet dingles) or blind as Captain Cat
				there in <span>the</span> muffled middle by <span>the</span> pump and <span>the</span> town clock,
				<span>the</span> shops in mourning, <span>the</span> Welfare Hall in widows' weeds.
				And all <span>the</span> people of <span>the</span> lulled and dumbfound town are
				sleeping now.</p>
			</div>

				<h4>Hush</h4>
				<p><span>the</span> babies are sleeping, <span>the</span> farmers, <span>the</span> fishers,
				<span>the</span> tradesmen and pensioners, cobbler, schoolteacher,
				postman and publican, <span>the</span> undertaker and <span>the</span> fancy woman,
				drunkard, dressmaker, preacher, policeman, <span>the</span> webfoot
				cocklewomen and <span>the</span> tidy wives. Young girls lie bedded soft
				or glide in their dreams, with rings and trousseaux,
				bridesmaided by glowworms down <span>the</span> aisles of the
				organplaying wood. <span>the</span> boys are dreaming wicked or of the
				bucking ranches of <span>the</span> night and <span>the</span> jollyrodgered sea. And
				<span>the</span> anthracite statues of <span>the</span> horses sleep in <span>the</span> fields,
				and <span>the</span> cows in <span>the</span> byres, and <span>the</span> dogs in <span>the</span> wetnosed
				yards; and <span>the</span> cats nap in <span>the</span> slant corners or lope sly,
				streaking and needling, on <span>the</span> one cloud of <span>the</span> roofs.</p>
			</div>

		<section>
			<div>
				<h4>You</h4>
				<p>can hear <span>the</span> dew falling, and <span>the</span> hushed town breathing.
				Only your eyes are unclosed to see <span>the</span> black and folded
				town fast, and slow, asleep. And you alone can hear the
				invisible starfall, <span>the</span> darkest-beforedawn minutely dewgrazed
				stir of <span>the</span> black, dab-filled sea where <span>the</span> Arethusa, the
				Curlew and <span>the</span> Skylark, Zanzibar, Rhiannon, <span>the</span> Rover,
				<span>the</span> Cormorant, and <span>the</span> Star of Wales tilt and ride.</p>
			</div>

				<h4>Listen. </h4>
				<p>It is night moving in <span>the</span> streets, <span>the</span> processional
				salt slow musical wind in Coronation Street and Cockle Row,
				it is <span>the</span> grass growing on Llaregyb Hill, dewfall, starfall,
				<span>the</span> sleep of birds in Milk Wood.</p>
			</div>	
		</section>

		<section>
			<div>
				<h4>Listen. </h4>
				<p>It is night in <span>the</span> chill, squat chapel, hymning in
				bonnet and brooch and bombazine black, butterfly choker and
				bootlace bow, coughing like nannygoats, sucking mintoes,
				fortywinking hallelujah; night in <span>the</span> four-ale, quiet as a
				domino; in Ocky Milkman's lofts like a mouse with gloves;
				in Dai Bread's bakery flying like black flour. It is to-night
				in Donkey Street, trotting silent, With seaweed on its
				hooves, along <span>the</span> cockled cobbles, past curtained fernpot,
				text and trinket, harmonium, holy dresser, watercolours
				done by hand, china dog and rosy tin teacaddy. It is night
				neddying among <span>the</span> snuggeries of babies.</p>
			</div>	
		</section>

		<section>
			<div>
				<h4>Look. </h4>
				<p>It is night, dumbly, royally winding through <span>the</span>
				Coronation cherry trees; going through <span>the</span> graveyard of
				Bethesda with winds gloved and folded, and dew doffed;
				tumbling by <span>the</span> Sailors Arms.</p>
			</div>	
		</section>

		<section>
			<div>
				<h4>Only</h4>
				<p>you can hear <span>the</span> houses sleeping in the streets in <span>the</span>
				slow deep salt and silent black, bandaged night. Only you
				can see, in <span>the</span> blinded bedrooms, <span>the</span> coms. and petticoats
				over <span>the</span> chairs, <span>the</span> jugs and basins, <span>the</span> glasses of teeth,
				Thou Shalt Not on <span>the</span> wall, and <span>the</span> yellowing dickybird-watching
				pictures of the dead.</p>
			</div>	
		</section>

		<section>
			<div>
				<h4>Only</h4>
				<p>you can hear and see, behind <span>the</span>
				eyes of the sleepers, <span>the</span> movements and countries and mazes
				and colours and dismays and rainbows and tunes and wishes
				and flight and fall and despairs and big seas of their dreams.

				From where you are, you can hear their dreams.</p>
