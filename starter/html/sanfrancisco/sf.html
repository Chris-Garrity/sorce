			<!-- Cable Car ======================================== -->

			San Francisco operates the famous cable cars, which have been designated as a National Historic Landmark.

			The Cable Car Museum is a working museum featuring the cable car power house, which drives the cables, and the car depot.

			<!-- Chinatown ======================================== -->		

			Chinatown has been traditionally defined by the neighborhoods of North Beach, and Telegraph Hill areas, as bound by Bush Street, Taylor Street, Bay Street, and the water.

			The area was completely destroyed in the 1906 earthquake, that leveled most of the city.
		
			<!-- Fishermen ======================================== -->		

			Fishermen settled in the North Beach area close to the wharf and fished for the local delicacies and the now famed Dungeness crab.

			The area is still home to many active fishermen and their fleets.

			<!-- Downtown ======================================== -->		

			Downtown includes the broader Union Square, Chinatown, Tenderloin, and SoMa districts as well.

			The neighborhood was completely destroyed in the 1906 Earthquake and Fire, although miraculously, the area's skyscrapers survived
