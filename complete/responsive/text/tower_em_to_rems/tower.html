				<p>The Tower of London has played a prominent role in English history. It was besieged several times. The Tower has served variously as an armoury, a treasury, a menagerie, the home of the <a href="http://www.royalmint.com/">Royal Mint</a>, a public records office, and the home of the <span>Crown Jewels</span>. From the early 14th century until the reign of Charles II, a procession would be led from the Tower to Westminster Abbey on the coronation of a monarch.</p>
